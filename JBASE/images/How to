I created this simple tool to assist the operator during the COB monitoring process.

Instructions for use:

1. Create a PGM.FILE with TYPE=M.
2. Create a LOCAL.TABLE named BEFORE.COB and AFTER.COB, assign it to TSA.SERVICE, and fill it (Y) if it is a BEFORE.COB or AFTER.COB service. (The local names are changeable, and you can also modify them in the code.)
Example:

JBASE QUERY: This will select all BEFORE services.
SELECT F.TSA.SERVICE WITH BEFORE.COB EQ 'Y'
Example:

JBASE QUERY: This will select all AFTER services.
SELECT F.TSA.SERVICE WITH AFTER.COB EQ 'Y'
